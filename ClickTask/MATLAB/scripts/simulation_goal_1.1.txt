The script for the CT model showed some flaws regarding completion of
simulation goal 1.
I list here the steps planned to pinpoint the flaw.

1. turn the computation of the posterior over state into a function for both DT
and CT model.

2. compare the quantitative values of the posterior over H+ in both models, for
the snr=0.5 case. --> conclude on size of discrepancy. If discrepancy seems
large, redo this step with a smaller DT time step.

3. refix the click time at 5 msec (not 4.9) in the CT model and investigate the
reason for the NaN values in the snr=4 case.
