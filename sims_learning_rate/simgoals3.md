Redo 3 for several values of the SNR.
Plot the posterior mean variance (with error bars) as a function of time. Put 1 curve per SNR value. So keep the number of SNR values around 6: something like 0.1; 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2; 3.

Add one theoretical curve corresponding to the infinite SNR case.

This will already answer the question about speed of learning.
