Redo 3, only for time step 1,000; for many SNR values (around 1,000). Then, compute also P (Correct) across the 1,000 trials; for each SNR value. 
Also, for each simulated trajectory, also run the non-learning model from SIAM Rev and compute P (correct).

Then, plot P (Correct) as a function of the posterior variance, and mark the single point coming from the SIAM model.

If 4 showed injection of the mapping SNR -> mean variance, then the plots from 5 should give us a notion of the impact of learning the rate on performance.
