We believe that with the right discretization of time, the ideal-observer 
model in the click-task with dynamic environment obeys the same equations
as our model from the Neural Comp paper.

This model computes the joint posterior over both state and change point 
count at every time step, recursively.

We would like to address the following questions both theoretically and 
numerically:

QUESTION 1: 
How does the joint probability mass evolve in time, as a function of the
type of evidence collected (00,11,10,01), and as Delta t ---> 0?
In particular, are there delta jumps for the observations 01,10, and 
continuous variation for 00 and 11?

QUESTION 2:
How does the variance of the posterior over the change rate decay?
This corresponds to the high-level question: How well and quickly can 
the change rate be learned by the observer?
The answer will depend at least on the SNR and on the value of the 
change rate.


QUESTION 3:
The third question is more general and not specific to this task.
How is performance impacted by the evidence accumulation model?
A few parameters to manipulate are:
- number of observations
- mean and width of the Beta prior over the change rate
- SNR
- type of algorithm: a) ideal-obs with delta prior on rate
b) ideal-obs with non-delta prior on rate
c) naive observer, with no integration of history
